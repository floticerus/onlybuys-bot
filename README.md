# bleep bloop

Watch new pairs & trade them on EVM networks.

## Usage

### GUI

The only required step at the moment is importing your private key in the app settings, and funding the account if you wish to trade. Read-only mode with no private key will be implemented soon.

### CLI

The CLI client is what powers the GUI app. It can be run by itself, and controlled by args & environment variables.

Better instructions coming soon(tm).

## Current support

- Avalanche
- BSC
